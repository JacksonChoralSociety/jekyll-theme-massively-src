## The Music of Kings and Queens
The choir is deep in preparations for our spring concert--our first under the baton of Austin Clark--"The Music of Kings and Queens". 

Make plans now to join us for an evening of diverse music featuring Mozart, Michael Jackson, Nat King Cole, and more! 

We will sing at 4 PM on April 23 in the sanctuary of Northside Methodist Church. We will see you there!
