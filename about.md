Mitzi Mathenia serves on the Music Ministry staff with her husband, Randy, at Northside United Methodist Church in Jackson, Tennessee, where for the past 23 years she has enjoyed being continually stretched and surprised. She is also on staff at Union University as an accompanist and plays for the Jackson Symphony. She graduated from Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis) and has four musical sons. Her greatest joys have been homeschooling her boys and seeing the countless ways God lets her participate in people’s lives with her piano playing. Her greatest passion is to worship God Almighty. And her greatest desire is to live in such a way that – as Bach signed his music, “Soli Deo Gloria” – people would be able to say, to God alone be the glory.
